bbPress Permalinks with ID
==========================

Change bbPress permalinks. Topic and forum ID instead of slug

This plugin for WordPress and bbPress converts default permalinks with topic and forum slugs to permalinks with ID's. Examples:

 * /forums/forum/FORUM_SLUG &rarr; /forums/forum/FORUM_ID
 * /forums/topic/TOPIC_SLUG &rarr; /forums/topic/TOPIC_ID

Real examples:
 * site.com/forums/forum/1/
 * site.com/forums/topic/2/
